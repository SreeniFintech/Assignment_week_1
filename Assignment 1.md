# Redefining Payments Sector – STRIPE ![alt text](stripe.png)
---
>## 1. Overview and Origin

The Payments sector of the world has moved into an era of electronic transactions. It is estimated that only about 8% of the world’s currencies exist in physical form, the rest is stored as digits inside computer memories. Fintech, which is a “fusion of finance and technology” has enabled leading edge innovations focussing on improving efficiencies, securities, speed of transactions, and consumer satisfaction. 

The sector has seen a steep rise with start-ups disrupting the payment sector with a simple motive of consumers wanting to meet payment deadlines with seamless transactions, and they were more likely to do so on platforms with high levels of security. It is imperative that for an eCommerce company to be successful, it must be safe, reliable, accessible, and quick.

>## 2. The BIG Idea

In 2009, the payment sector was limited to physical transactions that meant longer settlement periods and dependence on cards or banking systems for payment processing. With the advent of world wide web, and ability to reach out to millions of users, possibilities of payments on web was debated widely. For Start-ups and online businesses, the ability to accept payments felt like 1970s.

It was complex, antiquated, and in desperate need of a change. The financial barriers to starting a business were immense, more favourable to large corporations, and hardly encouraging for the small start-ups.  Businesses couldn’t devote enough of their time to working on their products because they had to deal with currencies, reporting, payment routing, and dozens of other financial hoops simply to allow customers to give them money.

It was late 2009 when Collison brothers started working on their payment acceptance service, dropping out of school and moving to Buenos Aires to work full-time on their revolutionary idea. They wanted to remove the need for startups to worry about the financial side of business, sot that the startups could invest more time and energy into their products and services. With a few internet businesses under their own belt, the Collisons were intimately aware of the problems of accepting payments.

>## 4. Business Activities

### 4.1 Financial Payment Domain Issues
With the rapid pace of innovation in the digital economy, digital commerce businesses need to have a robust payments platform.  They face with the following six primary financial problems that Stripe enables the ecommerce companies to overcome thorough its series of products
-  **Outdated financial infrastructure**: Digital commerce businesses must interact with numerous financial institutions, including ISOs, credit card providers, merchant acquirers, and depository institutions. 

- **Increased fraud**: With a growing proportion of global commerce occurring over the internet, credit card fraud has also increased. While chip-enabled credit cards have made brick-and-mortar shopping safer, fraudsters are increasingly targeting online sales. Digital commerce businesses that do not have a fraud prevention strategy and fraud protection technology will bleed money. 

- **Managing online marketplaces**: Online marketplaces are disrupting traditional digital commerce business models because efficiency is vastly improved, massive amounts of information are automatically tied into the workflows, and supply and demand pools are broader. With these benefits also come a multitude of complexities, such as processing multisided payments, onboarding and verifying merchants, providing tax paperwork, and operating across borders. 

- **Processing transactions in foreign markets**: Conducting digital commerce becomes much more complex when a company needs to process transactions in foreign currencies, meet country-specific regulations, and align with the requirements of foreign financial institutions. 

- **Managing connections to numerous apps**: Payment engines must integrate tightly with a company’s back-office and commerce applications. 

- **Off-putting checkout user experiences**: The vast majority of companies that build their own checkout flows make mistakes. In fact, of the top 100 commerce sites globally, almost half do not have autofill set up correctly, and one-fifth do not provide a numerical keypad for entering credit card numbers. This is a major friction point in commerce — web and mobile — that is caused by long or difficult checkout processes. The digital economy requires exceptional performance at the speed of transaction.
